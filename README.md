# Popcornflix

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Needed tools

We use NodeJS (which comes bundle with the node package manager NPM).
We use NPM to manage dependencies.
We use Grunt for running javascript tasks.
We use Bower to manage web dependencies.
We use Yeoman to generate the structure project. 
We use Sass (Compass) so we need to install it.
To be able to do this we need Ruby.
We use bundle to manage the ruby dependencies.
We also use Ionic that needs to be install.
And we need Cordova to use Ionic.

## [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

AngularJS is a javascript web application framework developed by Google.
It aims to simplify the development and the testing of web application.
It provides 
- An MVC architecture.
- A two-way data binding between html and javascript files (i.e. between views and controllers).
- Dependencies injections (brings simplicity, fiability, reutilisability and testability to the code).
- DOM manipulation thanks to "Directives".

### [ng-app](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp)

This is the directive to bootstrap an AngularJS app. This directive designates the root element.

### [ng-view](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/directive/ngView)

This directive is used to complement the service $routeProvider gives by AngularJS.
That allows the user to have a rooting in the application.

### [$routeProvider](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider)

There is the rooting of our application :
```
angular
  .module('popcornFlixApp', [
    'ngAnimate',
    'ngCookies',
    'ngResource',
    'ngRoute',
    'ngSanitize',
    'ngTouch'
  ])
  .config(function ($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
      .when('/', {
        templateUrl: 'views/movies.html',
        controller: 'MoviesCtrl',
        controllerAs: 'movies'
      })
      .when('/movie/:title', {
        templateUrl: 'views/movie.html',
        controller: 'MovieCtrl',
        controllerAs: 'movie'
      })
      .otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
      });
  });
```

We first define the **angular.module**, in which we give a name to our module and the list of modules that our module includes.
Then we use the **.config** method, its argument is a function that has as arguments the **$routeProvider** service.
And then we define the routes with the $routeProvider.
Here when the user go to the root of our app we load the page _movies.html_ where was the ng-view directive. Actually, we replace the ng-view directive by the page we load. It means that somewhere in our html pages we had an element like that :
`<ng-view></ng-view>`. This one is replaced by what is contained in the movies.html.
We also load a controller with the page that allows to had some logic associated at the view.

### [Services](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services)

We also have some services defined by angular. It is used to organize and share code across the application.
We here have services that permits to get a list of movies or the detals of a specific movie.
To see more explainations on our services you can just check our [file](https://github.com/GuillaumeRahbari/PopcornFlix/blob/master/WebApp/app/scripts/services/movieservice.js) that is very well documented.

### [Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

The angular directives are something powerful that permits to manipulate the DOM.
Our most important directives are used to define templates (others are some hack).
For example, every movie that we get (thanks to the service we used before) is build thanks to the template. It avoids duplication of code and makes the code more readable and maintenable.

## [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)

Ionic is a framework to create mobile applications with web technologies such as html, css and javascript.
To do this Ionic uses :
- Gulp : it is a javascript tasks runner.
- AngularJS
- Apache Cordova to create cross plateforms applications.
Ionic does the same thing that Cordova plus the power of AngularJS directives.
Ionic offers several directives to build apps faster.

### Create a first app

We already installed ionic throught npm. So we now have the `ionic` command available.
We just have to open a terminal and write `ionic start NameOfTheProject blank` (it is the simpliest starter, there are others such as `tabs` and `sidemenu`).
Ionic will scaffold all the application.
When it is finished you just can write `ionic serve` to previsualize your app in your favorite web browser.

###

The ionic command permit to do a lot of stuff.
- We can add a platform : `ionic add platform android`
- We can add a cordova plugin : `ionic plugin add myPlugin`
- We can build the project : `ionic build android`
- We can visualize the app in an emulator : `ionic emulate android`
- We can visualize the app in a real device : `ionic run android`


### The structure of the project

### Rooting

Ionic doesn't use the rooting provided by AngularJS, it uses the module [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/).
It based on states. But the way to use it is similary to the rooting of AngularJS.
Here is the rooting of the mobile app :
```
angular.module('starter', ['ionic'])
	.config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider){

    $stateProvider.state('home',{
      url:'/home',
      templateUrl: 'templates/home.html',
      controller: 'MoviesCtrl',
      controllerAs: 'movies'
    })

    $stateProvider.state('movie',{
      url:'/movie',
      templateUrl: 'templates/movie.html',
      controller: 'MovieCtrl'
    })

    $stateProvider.state('movies',{
      url:'/movies',
      templateUrl:'templates/movies.html',
      controller: 'MoviesCtrl'
    })

    $stateProvider.state('search',{
      url:'/search',
      templateUrl:'templates/search.html',
      controller: 'MoviesCtrl'
    })


    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/home')

  });
```
The rest is the same that we did in AngularJS except that we use the ion-nav-view directive.
```
<ion-nav-view>
</ion-nav-view>
```

### Controllers

Controllers are similar that those we wrote in the we application in AngularJs, we use them the same way.

### Services

We also use the same services that those we wrote in the web application in AngularJS.

### Directives

We also use similar directives that those we wrote in the web application in AngularJS.

### [ng-app](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp)

This is again the directive provided by AngularJS that bootstrap the application.

### [ion-nav-bar](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionNavBar/)

This directive is used to create easily a navbar in our application.
We use it like this :
```
<ion-nav-bar class="bar-positive">
	<ion-nav-back-button></ion-nav-back-button>
</ion-nav-bar>
```

### [ion-side-menu](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionSideMenus/)

To have a side-menu it is a little more complex.
```
<ion-side-menus>

  <ion-side-menu-content>

    <ion-nav-bar class="bar bar-dark">
      <ion-nav-back-button></ion-nav-back-button>
      <ion-nav-buttons side="left">
        <button class="button button-icon button-clear ion-navicon" menu-toggle="left"></button>
      </ion-nav-buttons>
      <ion-nav-buttons side="right">
        <button class="button button-icon button-clear ion-search" menu-toggle="right" ui-sref="search"></button>
      </ion-nav-buttons>
    </ion-nav-bar>
    <ion-nav-view></ion-nav-view>

  </ion-side-menu-content>

  <ion-side-menu side="left">

    <ion-item menu-close ui-sref="home">
      Home
    </ion-item>

    <ion-list>

      <ion-item class="bar bar-dark">
        Tops
      </ion-item>

      <ion-item menu-close ui-sref="movies">
        Movies
      </ion-item>

      <ion-item menu-close ui-sref="movies">
        Series
      </ion-item>

    </ion-list>

  </ion-side-menu>

</ion-side-menus>
```

### Sass

To use sass in ionic we just used the command `ionic setup sass`.
And then we added the gulp task :
```
gulp.task('default', ['sass']);

gulp.task('sass', function(done) {
  gulp.src('./scss/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./www/css/'))
});
```
